The coin change problem is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics that involves finding the minimum number of coins required to make a certain amount of change. Given a set of coins with different denominations and an amount of change to be made, the goal is to find the minimum number of coins required to make the change.Example:

* Input: sum = 4, coins[] = {1,2,3},

* Output: 4

* Explanation: there are four solutions: {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {2, 2}, {1, 3}.
